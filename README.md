# Langtons_Ant
A console app that simulates the movement of Langton's Ant , a two-dimensional universal Turing machine with a very simple set of rules. The rules are:  If the ant is on a white space, it turns right 90 degrees and changes the space to black. If the ant is on a black space, it turns left 90 degrees and changes the space to white. The simulation runs within user set variables of board size and steps. The simulation runs up to 15,000 steps, where the emergent order of the ant building a recurrent "highway" pattern starts at around 10,000 steps.
